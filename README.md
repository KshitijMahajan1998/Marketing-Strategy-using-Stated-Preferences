# Marketing-Strategy-using-Stated-Preferences

PROBLEM STATEMENT

• We want to find the factors that influence customer spending habits based on a survey response of
nearly a 1000+ users.
• Additionally, find out associations between hobbies, demographics, preferences and spending
habits of the young crowd.

PROPOSED SOLUTION

• We plan to use CHAID to find out the influencing factors. CHAID (Chi-Square Automatic Interaction Detector) analysis
is a market segmentation technique. CHAID finds patterns in data that has a lot of categorical variables although it also works for other
combinations of variables. It creates segments and then presents the data in a visual representation.
• To further find out the associations we plan to use various networking analysis such as Regularized
correlation Networks and Directed Acyclic Graph(DAG).
